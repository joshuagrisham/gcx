# Install `gcx`

## Quick install using the script

The fastest way to install `gcx` on Linux or macOS is with the script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/gcx/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The script: 

- Detects your operating system and architecture.
- Downloads the latest release from GitHub 
- Verifies the SHA-256 checksum.
- Installs the binary to `~/.local/bin`.

### Installer configuration options

Use these environment variables to customize the install script:

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `$HOME/.local/bin` | Directory to install the binary into |
| `VERSION` | latest | Specific version to install (e.g., `0.2.4`) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | unset | GitHub token for API requests (avoids rate limits) |

### Examples

Install a specific version:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/gcx/main/scripts/install.sh | VERSION=0.2.4 sh
```

Install to `/usr/local/bin`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/gcx/main/scripts/install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
```

### Uninstall

To remove `gcx`, delete the binary:

```sh
rm ~/.local/bin/gcx
```

## Install `gcx` with Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

To install `gcx` with Homebrew run:

```shell
brew install grafana/grafana/gcx
```

To upgrade an existing installation:

```shell
brew upgrade grafana/grafana/gcx
```

Homebrew builds `gcx` from source on your machine, as it pulls `go` as a build dependency.
The first install usually takes 30 to 60 seconds, and later upgrades reuse the Homebrew download cache.

This option avoids macOS Gatekeeper because it doesn't download a prebuilt binary. You
won't need to work around notarisation.

## Install a prebuilt binary

Prebuilt binaries are available for a variety of systems and architectures. Refer to the [release versions on GitHub](https://github.com/grafana/gcx/releases/latest) for more details.

To install a prebuilt binary:

1. Download the archive for the operating system and architecture you need.
1. Extract the archive.
1. Move the executable to the directory where you want to keep it.
1. Make sure that directory is in your `PATH`.
1. Make sure the file has execute permission.

If you use macOS, a manually downloaded binary might be blocked by Gatekeeper.
For more information, refer to [macOS Gatekeeper and killed: 9](#macos-gatekeeper-and-killed-9).

## Install `gcx` from source

To install `gcx` with Go, you need:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/).
- [`go`](https://go.dev/) 1.24 or later.

To install, run:

```shell
go install github.com/grafana/gcx/cmd/gcx@latest
```

## macOS Gatekeeper and killed 9

macOS quarantines any downloaded binary by default. Since `gcx` release binaries are not yet Apple-notarised, macOS may block it the first time you run it. If this happens, you'll see one of these two symptoms:

- **Intel macOS**: A dialog says, *"Apple could not verify 'gcx' is free of malware…"*, and the binary doesn't run.
- **Apple Silicon (M-series) macOS**: The binary exits immediately with `killed: 9` and no visible dialog.

**Homebrew users are not affected**. Since it compiles `gcx` from source on your machine, no pre-built binary is downloaded and no `xattr` is set.

### Bypass the macOS gatekeeper

In manual downloads, bypass this by clearing the `xattr` and ad-hoc sign the binary so Apple Silicon accepts it:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "$(command -v gcx)" 2>/dev/null || true
codesign --sign - --force "$(command -v gcx)"   # required on Apple Silicon
```

Next, run `gcx --version` again; subsequent invocations should succeed without the block. 

Note that these steps will no longer be necessary once `gcx` release binaries are Apple-notarised.
